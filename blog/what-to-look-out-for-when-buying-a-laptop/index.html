</time>¬∑ Mitja ≈†everkar</p><content><p><strong>WARNING:</strong> These are only guidelines, based on my experiences. It might not fit everyone&rsquo;s needs, but for most people, it does the trick.</p><p><strong>DON&rsquo;T BUY CHROMEBOOKS. THEY ARE PURE GARBAGE.</strong></p><h1 id=cpu>CPU</h1><p>Preferably get a relatively modern CPU (max 3 generations old), for example as of time of writing this, the latest AMD generation is 7th gen (Ryzen 7000), and for Intel it&rsquo;s 13th gen (Core 13xxx), therefore, your preferred CPU should be AMD Ryzen 4000 and above or Intel Core 10000. This ensures longevity of your laptop.</p><p>You should target for medium to high ground laptop CPUs. I found out, that Ryzen 5 and Intel Core i5 are great for their price, though Ryzen 7 and Intel Core i7 are also worth looking at.</p><p>Avoid especially all laptops that come with ancient processors and those that come with Intel Celeron or low-end AMD processors. These are very very low-end CPUs and can&rsquo;t do much more than basic browsing.</p><h1 id=gpu>GPU</h1><p>Integrated graphics (Intel Iris Xe, AMD Radeon Vega) will do, except if you&rsquo;re an extreme gamer (which I&rsquo;m not). You can save a lot of money on integrated graphics.</p><h1 id=ram>RAM</h1><p>Get at least 16GB or buy a laptop with less RAM, but that is upgradeable to at least 16GB of RAM in the future. You&rsquo;ll need it, trust me.</p><p><strong>NOT ALL LAPTOPS SUPPORT UPGRADING TO 16GB. LOOK CLOSELY AT THE SPECIFICATION SHEET FOR YOUR LAPTOP MODEL (EXACT MODEL NUMBER).</strong></p><h1 id=ssd>SSD</h1><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t cheap out and get a hard drive (HDD).</strong></p><p>SSDs are getting cheaper and cheaper every single day, therefore it&rsquo;s worth considering buying a laptop with a SSD, especially for the kind of performance you&rsquo;re gaining with them. Make sure you&rsquo;re getting at least 512GB (or 1TB if you have some money to spare) if you&rsquo;re going to single boot (boot one operating system) and at least a terabyte of storage if you&rsquo;re going to boot two operating systems (eg. Windows and Linux).</p><p>It&rsquo;s also recommended for your laptop to have another M.2 or SATA slot for having two disks in the same laptop.</p><h1 id=display>Display</h1><p>Don&rsquo;t cheap out and make the same mistake as I did with a TN panel. <strong>AVOID TN AT ALL COSTS. IT HAS VERY POOR VIEWING ANGLES.</strong> Go for an IPS panel or an OLED panel.</p><h1 id=audio-card>Audio card</h1><p>All audio cards should do the trick, except for Realtek ones. <strong>Realtek audio cards are utter garbage.</strong> Yes, they are cheap, but what you&rsquo;re getting is the shittiest sound in the entire world. External microphone is barely hearable on my laptop because of the Realtek card. If I plug in a USB sound card, the situation massively improves. Shame on you, Realtek.</p><h1 id=network-card>Network card</h1><p><strong>DON&rsquo;T BUY REALTEK NETWORK CARDS. THEY ARE UTTER GARBAGE WITH VIRTUALLY ZERO SUPPORT.</strong> WiFi connection randomly drops if you&rsquo;re using Realtek NIC on Linux, because Realtek doesn&rsquo;t provide us with actually functional drivers. You have to opt-in in a <a href=https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw88>third party driver</a> to improve the situation, but not make it perfect.</p><p>You&rsquo;d be better if you bought an Intel NIC (highly recommended, due to great support for all platforms, including Linux) or a Qualcomm NIC or literally anything else.</p><h1 id=os>OS</h1><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t install Windows 11.</strong> It lags so bad even on modern hardware.</p><p>Install Windows 10 or a Linux distribution (I recommend <a href=https://fedoraproject.org/>Fedora Linux</a>).</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/laptop/>#laptop</a>
