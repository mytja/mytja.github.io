I&amp;rsquo;m using a Samsung Galaxy A21s with. an Exynos chip, bought right here in Slovenia and is carrier unlocked.
When I was starting on rooting my phone, it was a horrible experience. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found many tutorials, which were beginner-friendly and some were riddled with words I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot while rooting my phone, have passed many challanges, such as bootloops, and would like to help a beginner to root their phone and potentially even install their custom ROM onto it.</description></item></channel></rss>
