It might not fit everyone&amp;rsquo;s needs, but for most people, it does the trick.
DON&amp;rsquo;T BUY CHROMEBOOKS. THEY ARE PURE GARBAGE.
CPU Preferably get a relatively modern CPU (max 3 generations old), for example as of time of writing this, the latest AMD generation is 7th gen (Ryzen 7000), and for Intel it&amp;rsquo;s 13th gen (Core 13xxx), therefore, your preferred CPU should be AMD Ryzen 4000 and above or Intel Core 10000.</description></item><item><title>How not to root a phone</title><link>https://severkar.eu/blog/how-not-to-root-a-phone/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://severkar.eu/blog/how-not-to-root-a-phone/</guid><description>This article is about rooting and installing custom OS onto a Samsung Exynos phone.
I&amp;rsquo;m using a Samsung Galaxy A21s with an Exynos chip, bought right here in Slovenia. The phone is carrier unlocked.
When I was starting on rooting my phone, it was a horrible experience. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found many tutorials, which were beginner-friendly and some were riddled with words I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot while rooting my phone, have passed many challanges, such as bootloops, and would like to help a beginner to root their phone and potentially even install their custom ROM onto it.</description></item></channel></rss>
